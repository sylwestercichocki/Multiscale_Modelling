# Multiscale-Modeling
Project created during Multiscale Modelling classes.
The goal of the project was to create a program that implements cellural automata and simple grain growth algorithm used to generate microstructures.
Application also inludes Monte Carlo growth algorithm and Monte Carlo recrystallization algorithm.
